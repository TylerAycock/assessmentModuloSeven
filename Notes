--------------Review of Results----------------
As the arrays scale in size, the run time for the insert funciton is significantly larger than that of the append function. Since the unshift() method adds items to the front of the arr, it forces the computer to adjust the index of each number that follows it. While this ins't big deal when you are dealing with small arrays like this,once you introduce a large data set, it will signifigantly affect run time. In conclusion the append function scales better!
